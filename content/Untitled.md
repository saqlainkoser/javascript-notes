### Definition

A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** connects multiple LANs across a city or metropolitan area.

It is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

**Range:** Approximately 5–50 km

### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Company with Multiple Offices**

```
Office A
    |
Office B
    |
Office C
    |

Campus 2
    |
Campus 3
```

Different campuses share the same network.

**Example 3: Smart City CCTV Network**

```
Traffic Signals

Police Control Room
      |
Railway Station
      |
Airport
```

Surveillance cameras are monitored centrally.

**Example 4: Cable TV Provider**

      |
Central Control Room
```

Operations are managed from one location.

### MAN Use Cases

### Definition

A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** connects networks across different cities, countries, and even continents.

The **Internet** is the largest example of a WAN.

### Real-World Examples

LAN → One Building
MAN → One City
WAN → Whole World
```

Or think of it this way:

- 📱 **PAN** = My Devices
- 🏠 **LAN** = My Home or Office
- 🏙️ **MAN** = My City

## Difference Between Intranet and Internet

### What is an Intranet?

An **Intranet** is a **private network** used within an organization. Only authorized users (employees, students, or staff) can access it.

**Example**

```
Employees
      |
Company Intranet
      |
HR Portal
Attendance System
Payroll
Internal Documents
```

Only company employees with valid login credentials can use these resources.

### What is the Internet?

The **Internet** is a **public global network** that connects millions of networks worldwide.

Anyone with an internet connection can access public websites and services.

**Example**

```
You
 |
ISP
 |
Internet
 |
Google
YouTube
Wikipedia
Netflix
Amazon
```

### Intranet vs Internet

|Feature|Intranet|Internet|
|---|---|---|
|Network Type|Private|Public|
|Users|Employees, students, organization members|Anyone with internet access|
|Accessibility|Restricted|Open to everyone|
|Security|Highly secure|Less secure because it is public|
|Ownership|Owned by one organization|No single owner|
|Purpose|Internal communication and resource sharing|Global communication and information sharing|
|Examples|HR Portal, Employee Attendance, Internal File Server, College ERP|Google, YouTube, Gmail, Wikipedia, Amazon|

### Real-World Examples

**Intranet**

- Company HR Portal
- Employee Attendance System
- Internal File Server
- Hospital Management System
- College ERP Portal
- Internal Email System

**Internet**

- Google Search
- YouTube
- Netflix
- Amazon
- Gmail
- Facebook
- WhatsApp
- Wikipedia

### Simple Analogy

Imagine a shopping mall:

- **Intranet** = **Employees-only area** (warehouse, staff room). Customers cannot enter.
- **Internet** = **Main shopping area** where everyone is welcome.
